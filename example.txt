Enter a message: I'm sad

Assistant: It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share your sadness. I'm here to listen and support you without judgment.
Can you tell me more about what's making you feel sad? Is it something that's happening in your life right now, or is it a feeling that's been building up for a while?
Sometimes, talking about what's on our minds can help us process our emotions and gain some clarity. I'm here to listen and offer support, not to try to fix everything or provide answers. Would you like to talk about what's been weighing on your heart?
